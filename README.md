### **Finding Optimal Policy for Warehouse Robot with Reinforcement Learning**
- Designed and implemented **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** and **Double DQN (DDQN)** algorithms to optimize robot navigation in a warehouse grid, enabling the agent to navigate obstacles, pick up items, and deliver them to designated locations using a structured reward system.
- Enhanced algorithm performance by utilizing a **replay buffer** for efficient learning and incorporating a **target network** for improved training stability, achieving consistent maximum rewards of 13 by fine-tuning hyperparameters (learning rate: 0.6, gamma: 0.6, epsilon decay).
